<title>Fidonet</title>

<p>These docs desperately need to be updated!  DD-Echo works fine!
WARNING! Fidonet support is in ALPHA-stage. DD supports
<strong>ONLY</strong> echomail.
Netmail is <strong>NOT</strong> supported yet.

<h1><a name="s1">1 Requirements</h1></a>

   <ul>
   <li>FTN address and a host for polling messages.
   <li>Mailer software. DayDream has been tested on ifmail, and it's probably
      the only software that DD supports. </ul>

<h1><a name="s2">2 Installation</h1></a>

<p>First install <strong>ifmail</strong>. Read the manual of it. Note that you need ONLY
ifindex and ifcico for DD. iftoss/ifpack etc are useless as they are used
for fido&lt-&gtusenet gateway.

<p>Then edit configs/tosser.cfg -file.

  <h2>Akas</h2>

    <p>Tosser supports multiple AKA-addresses, so you can have multiple
    networks. Standard aka-like looks like this:
 
    <pre>  AKA<N> <zone:net/node.point>
    </pre>
    <p>Where N is the number of AKA and the rest if self-explanatory.

    <p>AKA1 is the primary address. So if your primary address is 45:8/19.0,
    put this to configfile: "AKA1 45:8/19.0".

  <h2>Bad messages</h2>

    <p>There can be some bad messages in the message packet, for
    example there might be message to the area you have not
    configured. That kind of messages are imported to the area,
    you have defined as a bad message base. It should be local
    area because then you know what went wrong from the message
    kludges, and so you can configure DayDream so it will work.

    <p>Standard BAD-line looks like this:

      <pre>BAD [CONF]:[BASE]</pre>

    <p>For example, if you want to have base 6 of conference 10 as
    a bad base, put to your config file:

    <pre>  BAD 10:6</pre>
  
  <h2>Netmail</h2>

    <p>There might be a message in the inbound directory, that
    doesn't have an AREA:-kludge. This kind of messages will be
    imported as Netmail. Netmail can be sent anywhere on the globe,
    and is always private. Line NETMAIL in config-file defines
    the base to be used for Netmail messages.

    <p>Standard NETMAIL-line looks like this:

      <pre>NETMAIL [CONF]:[BASE]</pre>

    <p>For example, if you want to have base 5 of conference 10 as
    a netmail base, put to your config file:

      <pre>NETMAIL 10:5</pre>


  <h2>Inbound & Outbound directories</h2>

    <p>Tosser needs to know, where the received messages are
    located. It also needs to know, where you want to pack
    outgoing messages. Path for received messages is defined
    in INBOUND-line and for outgoing in OUTBOUND-line.

    <p>Here are examples:

<pre>INBOUND "/var/spool/ifmail/inb/"
OUTBOUND "/var/spool/ifmail/outb"</pre>

    <p>INBOUND requires /, OUTBOUND must NOT have /, because of the naming
    system of outgoing message packets.

  <h2>Packer definitions</h2>

    <p>You can have multiple packers for packing outgoing mail,
    but only 1 for decrunching mail. If you want to have more
    decrunchers, get a extracter, which detects which packer is
    used for packing message packets.

    <p>Standard packer line looks like this:
 
    <p>PACK[PACKERNUMBER] "[Commandline]". First %s is for name of
    archive and the second %s is for source file.
 
    <p>Eg:

    <pre>PACK1 "Lha a %s %s"</pre>

    <p>Standard unpack line looks like this:

    <p>UNPACK "[Commandline]". %s is a archive name to extract.

    <p>Eg:

    <pre>UNPACK "Lha e %s"</pre>
  

<h2>  Outgoing echo</h2>

   <p> To specify nodes/points which get some mail from you, you need
    to use list of outbound nodes. List begins with line "OUT:".
    The next lines are for specifications about nodes/points which
    get the mail packets from you. The line format is:

    <p>[4D ADDRESS] [TYPE] [PACKER] [AKA] [CONVERSION TABLE]

    <p>4D Address is a typical fidonet 4D address, eg. 9:866/3.0.
    Type specifies the method which is used to deliver packets to
    the current node. If it's H, node will call you to exchange the
    packets. If it's N, you will call the current node to exchange
    packets.

    <p>Packer specifies packer number to use.

    <p>Aka specifies aka to use in messages to this node.

    <p>Conversion table specifies outgoing conversion table ID
    (<kbd>$DAYDREAM/data/conversiontableXX.dat</kbd>) to use for outgoing message
    conversion. If your host/nodes want to use those perverted IBM-chars,
    this should be 2 if you're using default conversion tables, otherwise 0.

    <p>~ is end of the outbound definitions.

    <p>Example list:

<pre>OUT:
9:866/1.0 N 1 1 0
9:866/2.0 H 1 1 2
~</pre>

  <h2>Inbound conversion</h2>

    <p>It's possible to convert incoming messages. If you live in
    Scandinavia and you are member of dos-network, those linefeeds
    are really annoying. If you want to use conversion table, specify
    the conversion table number in "CONVERSION" line. Table will
    be taken from $DAYDREAM/data/-directory.

  <h2>Area definitions</h2>

    <p>To export echomail messages, you need to specify nodes who are
    polling area. Every area requires this. Format for AREA-line is

    <p>AREA [CONF]:[BASE] [List of 4d-addresses].

    <p>Eg:

    <pre>AREA 4:5 9:866/1.0 9:866/2.0</pre>

  <h2>Routing</h2>

    <p>Routing is required for sending netmail via many nodes, not directly
    to the destination. This makes netmail transferring cheaper and slower.

    <p>This is how it works:
<pre>
.--------------------------------.
| Netmail for eg. node 2:447/3.0.|
`--------------------------------'
                |
     Is this defined in outbound nodes?   eg. 2:477/3.0 N 1 1
                |
                +------------- yes -- Send it directly to it.
                |
                no
                |
Is there route entry for dest?       eg. 2:477/* 2:477/2.0
                |
		+------------- yes -- Send it to 2:477/2.0
		|
		no
		|
     Crashmail it to 2:477/3.0
</pre>

    <p>To specify routing, you'll need a table of route entries.
    List begins with line "ROUTE:" and next lines are for specifications
    about nodes to use for routing.

    <p>Format for lines is:

    <p>[PATTERN] [4D ADDRESS]

    <p>If destination matches with pattern, netmail will be sent to [4D ADDRESS].

    <p>4D Address is a typical fidonet 4D address, eg. 9:866/3.0.
    If it's -, mail won't be sent. First lines of the routetable
    should be used for your addresses to prevent tosser from sending your
    netmails forward.

    <p>~ is end of the routing definitions.

    <p>Example list:

<pre>ROUTE:
9:866/3.0 -
9:* 9:866/1.0
~</pre>

<h1><a name="s3">3 IFMail</a></h1>

  <p>It's VERY important that you change the files owned by ifmail to bbs.
  So, do <kbd>chown -R bbs /usr/lib/ifmail</kbd>, <kbd>chown -R bbs
/var/spool/ifmail</kbd>,
  <kbd>chmod -R bbs /var/logs/ifmail</kbd>.

  <p>This will make all the outgoing packets accessable for both, ifmail
  and DayDream.

  <p>For some strange reason ifcico chowns the incoming packets to root,
  if you run ifcico as a root, so chown them to bbs before running tosser
  or the tosser can't access them. Thank you.
