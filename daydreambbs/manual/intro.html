<title>DayDream BBS: Chapter 1</title>
<h1>1 <a name="s1"> Introduction </h1></a>
<p>
	DayDream BBS is fast and good  BBS program for Unix. It has
been written in C and unlike other unix BBS softwares, it has some features.
DayDream was originally written for AmigaOS, and the AmigaOS version was
still being developed by Mattias Nilsson until a few years ago.</p>

<h1>2 <a name="s2"> Features </h1></a>

<p><li><ul> Conference based. DayDream looks like AmiExpress/PCBoard/Desire.

<li><ul>Max number of conferences is 64. Each conference may have up to
254 message bases and up to 999 file areas.</ul>

<li><ul>Good securiry system. Each command can be turned on/off for each
user.</ul>

<li><ul>Most of the important utilities are included with DD. DD includes faker,
  chart generator utility, conftop etc..</ul>

<li><ul>Configuration in easy-to-edit ascii file.</ul>

<li><ul>Outlook almost 100% configurable.</ul>

<li><ul>Superb upload handling. DayDream is able to get and add
file_id.diz-files.</ul>

<li><ul>File flagging with cursor keys.</ul>

<li><ul>Up to 254 display modes. </ul>

<li><ul>Multinode support. DayDream recognizes dialup, telnet and local
  connections.</ul>

<li><ul>Doorlibrary for easy programming of add-on modules in C.</ul>

<li><ul>Supports Zmodem and FTP file transfers.</ul>

<li><ul>SysOp is able to view what the user is doing :)</ul>

<li><ul>Offline message reading/replying (QWK)</ul>

<li><ul>Background checker. DD puts files online while user is uploading
them</ul>

<li><ul>DD is able to handle fidonet echomail.</ul>

<li><ul>FTP file transfers are possible</ul>

<h1>3 <a name="s3"> Requirements</h1></a>

<li><ul>Each node eats about 400k of RAM. Running a good BBS requires also lots of
hard disk space. The more memory you have, the faster your system is.</ul>

<li><ul>For dial-up lines, you'll need mgetty. OTHER GETTIES WON'T WORK 100%.
Also make sure that mgetty inserts connect string from modem to
"from" field of utmp! Otherwise DD is unable to figure out the speed
of connection. (Note that from DD 2.04 DD can answer calls by itself too,
but using getty is more secure)</ul>

<li><ul>A brain</ul>

<h1>5 <a name="s5"> About this doc</h1></a>

<p>This documentation refers to $DAYDREAM/ in many parts. It is the home
directory for user bbs. However, you are not forced to use bbs as default
user, or /home/bbs as bbs'es home directory, but then you have to rethink
/home/bbs each time you read it in this documentation :))
