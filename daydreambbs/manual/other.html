<h1><a name="s1">1 Making DayDream answer the phonecalls</a></h1>

<p>It's not required to have mgetty to answer phone calls. From version 2.04
DayDream has been able to answer phonecalls by itself. Run DayDream with
command line parameter <kbd>daydream -n &lt;node&gt;</kbd>. Note that you need a console or
xterm to run a node. Modem is configured in
<kbd>$DAYDREAM/configs/modem&lt;node&gt;.cfg</kbd>.

<p>See example <kbd>modem1.cfg</kbd>, it is quite self-explanatory.

<p>DDSnoop is not supported on nodes that are answering the calls by themselves.

<p>It's not advicable to make DD answer the phonecalls. If DD crashes, it
dies and there's nothing that will answer the phone after this.

<p>This is just for those who are too stupid to configure mgetty correctly :)

<p>If DD says that it can't open serial port, make sure user bbs can access 
/dev/tty?? of the node.
