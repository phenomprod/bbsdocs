DayDream will support syslogd(8) eventually and some warnings are
logged via syslog already. To use this facility, add the following
to your /etc/syslog.conf:

local2.*	/var/log/ddlog

Having added this, reread the configuration file, i.e., send SIGHUP
to syslogd. Please consult the manpage for the explanation of the
line above.

Do not worry about the fixed local2 facility, it will be fully
configurable some day.
